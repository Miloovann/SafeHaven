# SafeHaven

# Inspiration
We were inspired to work on this project in a bid to help increase the outreach of Habitat for Humanity, a nonprofit organization that helps people build and improve their homes. Ultimately, the idea for this project came together when we decided to enlist the help of technology to educate people on the importance of decent housing.

# What it does
This project showcases various housing issues faced by people around the globe, such as lack of space, and afterwards offer several solutions that one could implement to better the outlook of their living spaces. At the same time, we provide various resources that interested individuals could have a look at to gain a more in-depth understanding of the topic, allowing them to decide which solution works best for them.

# How we built it
Using Firebase to host the website and W3.CSS as its framework, we built up the website for Project Safe Haven, at the same time utilising several files that we uploaded on Google Cloud Storage.

# Challenges we ran into
As we were rather new to Firebase at the start, we faced some issues with the hosting of our website, however, after some time of getting ourselves up to speed with the basics, we fixed our errors and successfully hosted our website.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
One of the things we're most proud of is our ideation process, where we diligently brainstormed ideas together on how one could combine modern technology with educating the public on housing, which is a topic not commonly considered when it comes to solving societal issues. Thankfully, after a considerable amount of time pondering over it, our group came to an ultimate conclusion that our current implementation is among the best conceivable.

# What we learned
We learnt that it's common to face problems when working on an area as niche as technology, however it's important that we research and figure out ways to solve it independently in order to become more experienced in this field.

# What's next for Project Safe Haven
As part of our future works, we intend to increase the potential of this website. This would be done firstly by creating a forum for people to come together and ideate on better solutions to improve the homes of people globally, and secondly by sourcing for ways to promote awareness of our platform so as to increase our outreach and ultimately get people to put their heads together and improve the current situation of worldwide housing.
